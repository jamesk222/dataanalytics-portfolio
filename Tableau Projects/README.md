TechHub Retail: 2025 Strategic Planning Report
1. Introduction
TechHub Retail, a burgeoning UK-based online electronics retailer, has experienced significant growth over the past 18 months. However, this rapid expansion has outpaced the development of robust, data-driven analytical capabilities. In the absence of comprehensive insights, the company faces a critical challenge in formulating a data-informed strategy for 2025. This report addresses that need by presenting a detailed analysis of sales, customer, and product data to identify growth opportunities and inform strategic decision-making.
The purpose of this report is to provide the executive leadership with a clear, concise, and actionable view of business performance. It is supported by an interactive Tableau Public dashboard, which serves as the primary tool for ongoing monitoring and deeper analysis. The scope of this analysis covers 18 months of historical data, from January 2023 to June 2024, to identify key trends, patterns, and predictive insights that will be crucial for 2025 planning.
2. Multi-Dataset Integration Summary
To create a holistic view of the business, three distinct datasets were integrated and transformed within Tableau Public.
Data Connection and Joins: The three datasets—TechHub_Sales_Data.csv, TechHub_Customers.csv, and TechHub_Products.csv—were connected to Tableau as text files. A data model was established by performing two inner joins:
TechHub_Sales_Data was joined with TechHub_Customers using the common key customer_id.
TechHub_Sales_Data was also joined with TechHub_Products using the common key product_id.
This approach ensures that all visualizations are based on a single, clean, and comprehensive data source, where every transaction is correctly linked to its corresponding customer and product details.
Calculated Fields: Several key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics were calculated to enrich the analysis:
Profit Amount: Calculated as [Revenue] - ([Cost Price] * [Quantity]). This field provides the true profitability of each transaction, a fundamental metric for understanding financial health.
Profit Margin %: Calculated as ([Profit Amount] / [Revenue]) * 100. This metric standardizes profitability, allowing for direct comparison across different products, categories, and suppliers, regardless of their revenue size.
Customer Tenure Days: Calculated as DATEDIFF('day', [Signup Date], TODAY()). This field helps to segment customers by their longevity with the company, a key variable for customer segmentation analysis.
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Calculated as {FIXED [customer_id]: SUM([Revenue])}. This Level of Detail (LOD) expression aggregates total revenue for each unique customer, providing a powerful metric for customer segmentation and channel analysis.
Product Age Days: Calculated as DATEDIFF('day', [Launch Date], [Order Date]). This metric allows us to analyze how sales performance changes over a product's lifecycle.
Data Relationship Challenges: A primary challenge involved ensuring a consistent and accurate link between the three datasets. An initial check revealed no significant mismatches between customer_id and product_id across the joined files, mitigating concerns of orphaned data. The use of inner joins effectively resolved any potential data integrity issues by only including records with a match in all three tables, thus ensuring a "single source of truth" for the analysis.

3. Dashboard Design Summary
The Tableau Public dashboard was designed with a clean, executive-focused layout to provide a high-level overview while enabling detailed exploration. The layout is structured to present the most critical KPIs first, followed by granular visualizations that support deeper inquiry.
Dashboard Layout and Key Visualisations:
Executive KPI Dashboard: The top section of the dashboard features six key metrics: Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Total Customers, Customer Acquisition Rate, Average Profit Margin, and a bar chart showing the top customer segments by revenue. Each KPI includes a month-over-month growth indicator to provide immediate performance context.
Sales & Profitability Trends: A dual-axis line chart visualizes revenue and profit over time, clearly showing seasonal peaks and troughs. An integrated Tableau forecast extends the trend lines into 2025, offering a data-backed projection.
Geographic Performance: A filled map of the UK provides a quick visual of revenue distribution by region and city, with an intuitive drill-down hierarchy for localized insights.
Product Portfolio Analysis: A treemap visualizes the product categories. The size of each rectangle represents revenue, while the color intensity indicates the profit margin, making it easy to spot high-revenue, high-margin categories at a glance.
Customer Segmentation Matrix: A scatter plot with Customer Lifetime Value on the y-axis and Customer Tenure Days on the x-axis, segmented by loyalty tier and age group, reveals which customer demographics are most valuable over time.
Supplier & Product Performance: A horizontal bar chart ranks suppliers by total revenue, with tooltips providing product count and other key metrics, allowing for an assessment of supplier performance.
Interactive Features and User Navigation: The dashboard is highly interactive, allowing executives to explore the data without needing an analyst. Key features include:
Global Date Range Filter: A single filter at the top right of the dashboard controls the time frame for all visualizations, allowing users to slice the data by year, quarter, or a custom range.
Multi-select Filters: Filters for Product Category and Customer Loyalty Tier enable focused analysis on specific market segments.
Geographic Drill-down: The map allows users to click on a region to automatically filter down to city-level data, providing local insights.
Tooltips and Highlights: Hovering over any data point (e.g., a bar on a chart, a region on the map) reveals detailed information, while clicking highlights the selected data across all other visualizations.

4. Key Insights & Findings
The integrated data analysis revealed several critical insights for TechHub Retail's 2025 strategy:
Seasonal Trends: A clear seasonal pattern was observed with sales and profit peaking in November and December, likely driven by Black Friday and Christmas shopping, and experiencing a noticeable dip in the summer months (July-August). This pattern is consistent across most product categories but is particularly pronounced in "Laptops & Computers" and "Smartphones."
Customer Behavior: The customer segmentation matrix revealed a strong positive correlation between Customer Tenure Days and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). "Loyalty Tier Gold" customers, although a smaller segment, exhibit significantly higher CLV and average order value, indicating that nurturing existing, long-term customers is more profitable than simply acquiring new ones.
Product Performance: The treemap analysis showed that while "Laptops & Computers" generate the highest overall revenue, "Wearables" and "Home Automation" categories offer superior profit margins (exceeding 30%). This suggests a potential strategic trade-off between volume and profitability.
Regional Disparities: The geographic map highlighted that the London and South East regions contribute a disproportionately large share of total revenue. However, when normalized by the number of customers, "Revenue per Customer" is surprisingly high in some smaller, less-populated regions, suggesting untapped market potential in those areas.
Product Age: An analysis of Product Age Days showed that sales performance for new products peaks within the first 60 days of launch, with a gradual decline afterward. This highlights the importance of timely marketing and inventory management for new releases.
5. Business Questions Answered
Which product categories and suppliers offer the best profit margins for 2025 focus?
The "Product Portfolio Analysis" treemap clearly identifies "Wearables," "Home Automation," and "Gaming Consoles" as the product categories with the highest average profit margins. The Supplier & Product Performance chart, when filtered by Profit Margin % in descending order, highlights suppliers like "Aether Corp" and "Quantum Tech" as offering the most profitable product lines. This suggests a strategic focus on sourcing and marketing from these suppliers and prioritizing these high-margin categories.
How do customer demographics (age, location, loyalty tier) impact purchasing behavior?
Loyalty Tier: "Gold" tier customers, though comprising only 10% of the customer base, generate over 40% of the company's total revenue. Their purchasing frequency and average order value are substantially higher.
Age: The 25-44 age group is the most significant segment in terms of both customer count and total revenue. They also show a high propensity for purchasing higher-ticket items like laptops and smartphones.
Location: While major urban centers like London and Manchester generate the highest total revenue, smaller regions with high "Revenue per Customer" suggest localized, high-value customer pockets that could be targeted with specific marketing campaigns.
What seasonal patterns exist across different product categories and regions?
The dual-axis line chart confirms a significant seasonal surge in sales and profit during the Q4 holiday season (November-December). This pattern is especially strong for "Laptops & Computers" and "Gaming Consoles," suggesting that these products are popular gift items. Regional analysis shows that this seasonal trend is universal across the UK, but the London and South East regions experience the most significant absolute revenue spike.
Which customer acquisition channels deliver the highest lifetime value customers?
The dashboard currently lacks a direct link between customer acquisition channels and transaction data. However, by analyzing the Signup Date and Customer Tenure Days alongside Customer Lifetime Value, we can infer that customers with a longer tenure and higher CLV were likely acquired through channels that build trust and long-term relationships (e.g., content marketing, organic search) rather than short-term promotional channels. Future analysis would require a dedicated Acquisition Channel field in the customer data to definitively answer this question.
How does product age (time since launch) correlate with sales performance?
The Product Age Days calculated field, when analyzed against sales volume, shows that the vast majority of sales occur within the first 6 months of a product launch. This suggests that marketing efforts and inventory stocking should be heavily front-loaded in the product lifecycle, with a strategic plan for managing end-of-life inventory.
What are the top 3 strategic recommendations based on integrated data analysis?
Recommendation 1: Optimize Product Portfolio for Profitability. Shift marketing and inventory focus towards high-margin categories like Wearables and Home Automation, especially during seasonal sales events.
Recommendation 2: Enhance Customer Loyalty Programs. Invest in targeted campaigns to upsell and retain high-value "Gold" tier customers.
Recommendation 3: Capitalize on Seasonal and Regional Opportunities. Pre-plan inventory and marketing campaigns to maximize the Q4 holiday surge, and launch localized marketing efforts in smaller regions with high per-customer spending.
6. Strategic Recommendations
Based on the key findings, here are 3-4 actionable recommendations for TechHub's 2025 strategy:
Strategic Recommendation: Optimize the Product Portfolio and Supplier Relationships.
Justification: Analysis showed a significant difference in profitability between categories. Wearables and Home Automation offer margins well above the company average. Suppliers like Aether Corp consistently provide high-margin products.
Implementation: Negotiate preferred partnerships with top-performing suppliers to secure better pricing. Reallocate marketing budgets to promote high-margin products, especially during the pre-holiday season.
Expected Impact: A 5-8% increase in overall average profit margin by Q4 2025, without a proportional reduction in total revenue.
Strategic Recommendation: Develop a Tiered Customer Retention and Engagement Program.
Justification: The customer segmentation matrix revealed that long-term "Gold" tier customers are the most valuable asset. Acquiring new customers is expensive, while retaining existing ones is far more cost-effective.
Implementation: Launch personalized email campaigns offering exclusive deals and early access to new products for "Gold" and "Silver" tier customers. Implement a tiered rewards program that encourages repeat purchases and provides tangible benefits for customer loyalty.
Expected Impact: A 10% reduction in customer churn and a 15% increase in average CLV for the top two loyalty tiers by the end of 2025.
Strategic Recommendation: Implement a Localized Marketing and Inventory Strategy.
Justification: While major cities drive volume, the analysis identified smaller regional markets with high-value customers. The Q4 seasonal spike is a consistent and predictable trend.
Implementation: Allocate a portion of the marketing budget to geofenced digital ad campaigns targeting high-performing smaller regions. Use the forecasting insights to pre-order and strategically position inventory for laptops and gaming consoles in regional distribution centers ahead of the Q4 rush to minimize shipping times and costs.
Expected Impact: A 5% increase in revenue from non-major urban areas and a 20% improvement in Q4 order fulfillment efficiency.
7. Critical Reflection
The executive dashboard is highly effective for its intended purpose. It provides a quick, visual overview of key business metrics, enabling executives to monitor performance at a glance and quickly identify areas that require attention. The interactive features, such as filters and drill-downs, empower users to conduct self-service analysis, reducing the dependency on the BI team for routine queries.
However, there are areas for improvement. Future iterations of the dashboard could benefit from a more sophisticated predictive model that provides a confidence interval for the 2025 forecast. The dashboard also lacks a direct link to marketing channel data, which is a critical missing piece for optimizing customer acquisition spend. The current reliance on manual interpretation of customer data could be automated with a more advanced segmentation model (e.g., using a Recency, Frequency, Monetary value or RFM model).
8. Data Issues or Risks
While the current datasets were relatively clean, some potential limitations and risks exist:
Data Imbalance: The distribution of revenue is highly skewed towards a small number of customers (the "Gold" tier) and a few major regions. While this is a real business insight, it can make certain analyses on the smaller segments less statistically significant.
Missing Features: A significant risk is the absence of a dedicated Customer Acquisition Channel field in the data. Without this, we can only infer which channels are successful, not definitively prove it. This limits the ability to make data-driven recommendations on marketing budget allocation.
Forecasting Assumptions: The Tableau forecast is based on historical trends. While it's a powerful tool, it does not account for external market factors, such as new competitors entering the market or a sudden change in economic conditions. It is a projection, not a guarantee.
Time Since Launch: The Product Age Days metric is a useful proxy, but it doesn't account for product updates, refreshes, or different versions, which could lead to misinterpretations of a product's lifecycle.
