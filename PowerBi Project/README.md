1.0 Problem Statement: High Operating Margin, Low Operating Profit in Online Sales ChannelAdidas operates in a highly fragmented retail landscape, with various distribution channels, including company-owned stores or in-store, third-party retailers or outlets, and e-commerce or online platforms. The problem pertains to the discrepancy between high operating margin and low operating profit in the online sales channel Adidas. Despite having a higher operating margin in the online sales channel compared to in-stores and outlets, the operating profit for Adidas in the online channel is lower than that of in-stores and outlets for the years 2020-2021. This discrepancy between high operating margin and low operating profit suggests that while Adidas is generating significant revenue from online sales, the profitability of these sales is not as strong as those from in-store and outlet channels (Source: Exceldataset).
2.0 Causes of Low Operating Profit in Online Sales ChannelDespite the online channel's higher operating margin compared to in-store and outlet channels, the significant operational costs specific to online operations, such as website maintenance, digital marketing expenditures, and fulfillment/shipping costs, are likely eating into profitability. These costs may not be adequately optimized or controlled, leading to a disproportionate increase in expenses relative to revenue. Additionally, inefficiencies within online operations, such as suboptimal processes or resource allocation, may further exacerbate the cost burden without a corresponding increase in revenue generation. Furthermore, while the online channel enjoys a higher margin, factors such as pricing strategy, sales volume, or customer acquisition costs may be impeding the channel's ability to realize its full profit potential (Lu, 2003 & Mu et al., 2021).Referring to the dashboard below, the sum of price per unit is high in online sale channel as compared to outlet and in-stores.
3.0 Recommendations:The recommendation for the problem discussed before entail a multifaceted approach aimed at addressing the underlying causes and optimizing profitability in Adidas's online sales channel for the years 2020-2021. Firstly, conducting a comprehensive analysis of cost structures and revenue drivers specific to the online channel is crucial. This analysis will enable the identification of areas of improvement and inform strategic interventions to optimize operational efficiency and reduce costs (Xia, 2011 & Tung, 2018). Secondly, reviewing and potentially adjusting pricing strategies for online products to better align with profitability targets while remaining competitive in the market is essential (Faith & Agwu, Prof Edwin, 2018). Additionally, focusing on enhancing the online shopping experience to drive increased sales volume and customer loyalty, coupled with leveraging data analytics and performance metrics for continuous monitoring and evaluation, will be pivotal in maximizing profitability and ensuring sustainable growth in the digital marketplace (Khalifa & Liu, 2007 & Le & Liaw, 2017).
4.0 ConclusionIn essence, the analysis conducted using Power BI sheds light on Adidas's sales performance in the USA and proposes a business intelligence and data analytics system to address key issues. The discrepancy between high operating margin and low operating profit in the online sales channel has been identified as a critical problem, with potential causes ranging from operational costs specific to online operations to inefficiencies in processes and resource allocation. This misalignment not only impacts revenue generation but also has broader implications for business strategy, resource allocation, and shareholder confidence. Leveraging the theoretical frameworks and the business intelligence layer, a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities within Adidas's sales department has been attained. The proposed Power BI dashboard offers interactive visualizations and customizable KPI widgets to empower users with actionable insights for optimizing sales strategies. Moving forward, addressing the identified issues and implementing the proposed solutions will be imperative for Adidas to thrive in the competitive US market and maximize profitability.
