Project Summary: Synthetic Weather and Sales Data Analysis of Lemonade Stand
This project aimed to explore the relationship between daily weather conditions (specifically temperature and sunniness) and sales figures. Given an initial small sample, the first crucial step was to synthetically generate a larger, more comprehensive dataset to enable robust analysis.
1. Data Generation and Preparation:
•	A custom Python script was developed to create a dataset spanning five years of daily records. This synthetic generation allowed for controlled simulation of realistic patterns:
o	Seasonal temperature variations (warmer in summer, colder in winter).
o	Probabilistic sunniness linked to temperature (warmer days more likely to be sunny).
o	Sales patterns influenced by:
	Day of the week (e.g., higher sales on weekends).
	Temperature (generally higher sales with higher temperatures).
	Sunniness (additional boost on sunny days).
•	The generated data included Day (as YYYY-MM-DD), Temperature, Sunny (Yes/No), and Sales.
•	Crucially, meticulous attention was paid to saving the dataset locally in a CSV format, overcoming initial hurdles related to file pathing and ensuring data integrity for subsequent steps.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Findings:
After successfully generating and loading the dataset, a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis was performed to understand its characteristics and uncover initial relationships:
•	Data Structure and Quality:
o	The dataset was confirmed to be clean with no missing values, thanks to the controlled synthetic generation process.
o	The Day column was successfully converted to a datetime format, and several new features were engineered from it (Year, Month, DayOfWeek, WeekOfYear, DayOfYear, Quarter) to facilitate time-based analysis.
•	Univariate Insights:
o	Temperature: Exhibited a clear seasonal distribution, with higher temperatures concentrated in summer months.
o	Sales: Showed a skewed distribution, indicating that most days have moderate sales, with a tail extending to higher sales days.
o	Sunny Days: The dataset likely contains more sunny days in warmer months, reflecting the probabilistic generation.
o	Day of Week: As expected from the generation logic, Sales were notably higher on weekends (especially Saturdays), indicating a strong weekly pattern.
•	Bivariate and Multivariate Relationships:
o	Temperature and Sales: A strong positive correlation was observed between Temperature and Sales. As temperatures rise, sales tend to increase, suggesting a direct relationship.
o	Sunniness and Sales: Sunny days consistently showed higher average sales compared to non-sunny days, even for comparable temperatures, highlighting the independent positive impact of sunshine on sales.
o	Sales Seasonality: Both line plots and box plots over Month clearly demonstrated seasonal trends in sales, peaking during warmer periods (likely summer months) when temperatures are highest.
o	Combined Effects: The analysis confirmed that warmer, sunny weekend days are the periods with the highest sales potential, reflecting the synergistic impact of these factors.
In summary, this project successfully leveraged synthetic data generation to simulate a complex real-world scenario. The subsequent EDA provided robust evidence of the expected relationships: sales are positively influenced by both higher temperatures and the presence of sunny weather, with significant boosts observed on weekends and during warmer seasons. These findings lay a strong foundation for further analytical tasks, such as building predictive models for sales forecasting.
